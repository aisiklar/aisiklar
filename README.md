Hello :)

I am a software / web developer (front-end focused, full-stack), a career-changer and a lifetime learner.

I am ambitious about developing software, especially web applications. 

Additionally I am interested in open source projects, AI within Web Apps, web performance and productivity.

Outside software, I also love music and I am learning to play flute...

Unfortunately, it is still being updated, hope to publish the new version soon, if i can find some time to work on it :)

See you around, feel free to contact me for anything related with development.

alptekin I.
