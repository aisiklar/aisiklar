Hello :)

I am a software / web developer (front-end focused, full-stack), a career-changer and a lifetime learner.

I am ambitious about developing software, especially web applications. 

Additionally I am interested in open source projects, AI within Web Apps, web performance and productivity.

Other than software development, I love music and I am learning to play flute.

alptekin I.
