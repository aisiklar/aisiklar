- 👋 Hi, I’m alptekin.
- 👀 I’m ambitious about developing / coding, particularly Web development. Nowadays working intensely with javascript, next.js, react.js, node.js and express.js. Additionally, I have some familiarity and experience with vue.js, electron.js and python, too.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects (preferably with/in javascript, next.js, react.js, node.js). If you know a good OSS Project for me to contribute to, reach out to me... I am already interested :)
- 📫 How to reach me: https://m-alptekin.com OR https://www.linkedin.com/in/alptekinisiklar/ Let's connect.
