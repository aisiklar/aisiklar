Hello :)

I am a software / web developer (front-end focused, full-stack), a career-changer and a lifetime learner.

I am ambitious about software / web development and interested in Open Source, Web Performance and combining AI with Web Development.

In addition to software development, I love music and I play flute (amateurish).

Feel free to contact me in case you think we have common interests.

alptekin I.
